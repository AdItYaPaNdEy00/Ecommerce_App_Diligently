Technical Architecture Document — E-Commerce Demo (Diligently)

Project: E-Commerce_App (React + Express + MongoDB Atlas)
Author: Aditya Pandey


1. Executive summary

This project is a lightweight full-stack e-commerce demo that allows users to:

Browse products (list),

Inspect product details,

Add/remove items from a shopping cart (client-side state persisted in localStorage).

Frontend (client/) is a Vite React app. Backend (server/) is an Express API using Mongoose to talk to MongoDB Atlas. The README contains run steps and available endpoints.

2. High-level architecture
[Browser / Client]
   React (Vite) + React Router + Cart Context
         |
         | HTTP JSON (VITE_API_BASE -> http://localhost:5000)
         v
[Backend API - Express]
   Routes:
     GET /api/health
     GET /api/products
     GET /api/products/:id
   Mongoose models
         |
         v
[MongoDB Atlas Cluster]
   products collection


Requests flow: UI → REST API → DB → JSON response → UI updates state (and localStorage for cart).

(README lists these endpoints and stack).

4. Component & module breakdown
Frontend (client/)

Routing

Home → product list (calls GET /api/products)

ProductDetail → product details (calls GET /api/products/:id)

Cart → shows cart, manage quantities and remove items

State

CartContext implemented using React.createContext + useReducer

Persists cart to localStorage so user cart survives reloads

API layer

Single service file (e.g., api.js) that reads base URL from VITE_API_BASE and exposes functions: getProducts(), getProductById(id)

Styling

Handcrafted CSS (responsive layouts, Grid/Flexbox, mobile-first breakpoints)

Backend (server/)

Server entry (index.js / app.js)

Loads server/.env for MONGODB_URI, PORT, CLIENT_ORIGIN

Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose

Enables CORS for CLIENT_ORIGIN (development)

Models

Product schema: typical fields — name, description, price, image, category, countInStock, etc.

Routes

GET /api/health → simple { status: 'ok' }

GET /api/products → returns list

GET /api/products/:id → returns single product or 404

Optional POST /api/seed (or seed script) used to populate demo products

Seed

npm run seed populates the products collection with demo data (used for initial testing)

(Readme documents the above setup and environment variables).

5. Data model (recommended / example)

Product (Mongoose schema — representative)

{
  name: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  image: String,       // URL or static path
  category: String,
  brand: String,
  countInStock: Number,
  rating: Number,
  numReviews: Number,
  createdAt: Date
}


This model supports listing, detail view and basic inventory (stock) logic in future.

6. Environment & config

server/.env

MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-uri
PORT=5000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173


client/.env (optional)

VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000


(These are present in README run steps). 

README

7. Run & dev workflow (from README)

Backend

cd server
npm install
# add server/.env (with MONGODB_URI)
npm run seed   # optional
npm run dev    # http://localhost:5000


Frontend

cd client
npm install
# optional client/.env
npm run dev    # http://localhost:5173


(README includes these exact commands).
